## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

### How to Contribute:

1.  **Open an Issue:** Before starting any significant work (like a new Transport implementation or a major feature), please open an Issue first. This helps us discuss the proposed changes and avoid duplicated work.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the `FireRest` repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Always create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/alamofire-transport`).
4.  **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes and push your branch to your Fork.
5.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Target the `main` branch of the original `FireRest` repository. Please provide a clear description of the changes in the PR body.

### Standards:

* **Style:** Please maintain the existing coding style and English documentation/comments.
* **Testing:** If you add complex logic, please include Unit Tests if possible.
